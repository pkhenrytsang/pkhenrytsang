Hi, I am Pak Ki Henry Tsang. I am a ML/AI Engineer at Amazon.

Before I transition to industry, my research interest is to study quantum phase transitions, with emphasis on computational methods. My line of work involves solving non-linear sets of equations with a variety of Mathematical methods.

If you are interested in using my code for your research, please feel free to do so with proper references. If there are any questions such as regarding use of code, contact me at henrytsang222@gmail.com
